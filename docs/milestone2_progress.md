   ### Since Milestone1
   Yanis and Elaine had a meeting with our TF in order to thoroughly understand the feedback. Afterwards, the group worked together to update the "Implementation" section and the "How to Use" section per the feedback. We encountered merge conflicts while submitting Milestone 2A, requiring Yanis, Tadhg and Elaine to research options. We finally were able to solve the merge conflict using the "git revert" command, after carefully considering the "git reset" command. Chelsey updated the "How to Use" section and Yanis and Loralee helped her to check the new Implementation. Tadhg updated the implementation with the help of Elaine and Yanis to explain how to overload the elementary functions such as sin, cos, and exp by creating a file to define these functions in our package. Yanis adjusted the software organization to incorporate these changes in our project structure.
   
   ### For Milestone2
   Chelsey, Elaine, and Yanis will focus on Forward mode implementation. Tadhg and Loralee will focus on test suite code and documentation.
   Please find a breakdown of the tasking for each member:
   
   1. *Chelsey*
       1. Forward mode evaluation
   2. *Elaine*
       1. Implement dual number in forward mode evaluation
   3. *Loralee*
       1. Test that the dual number class and forward mode classes are correctly implemented
   4. *Tadhg*
       1. Test that the function module and forward mode class are correctly implemented 
   5. *Yanis*
       1. Overload basic operations
   6. *All*
       1. Contribute to their respective documentation
       2. Research and explore options for our proposal for additional features. Currently there is group interest in creating a visualization for the computational graph.
